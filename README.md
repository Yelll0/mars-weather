# Mars Weather
> What's the weather like on Mars? 
This is a small test project to learn full stack web development technologies in preparation for Hack the North 2020++. The technologies in questions are Bootstrap and ReactJS for the frontend, and Flask for backend work. It uses the NASA InSight Mars Weather Service API to access weather data on the martian surface, and uses the NASA Image and Video Library for images.
